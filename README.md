Documentation:

Within this project we were tasked to make a Generative art piece (“Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system.” - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art ) that either displayed new static content each time its run or changes according to user interactions such as mouse movements. We were tasked with using no less than two of these elements:
 
I started the project by looking at artists who primarily work with Generative art such as Aza Raskin, Pascal Dombis and Nervous System.

Aza Raskin – Algorithm Ink:
Algorithm Ink is an extension of a program called Context Free written by Aza Raskin. Algorithm Ink makes use of Open-web standard based tools so that the user can use the program without the need of plugins. Algorithm Ink is a program that creates patterns using code from the user such as:

 
Which creates:
 
This can be used to create virtually anything that the user can think of and code using the language found in the Context Free documentation.
I used ideas from this program such as the variety of colours and stroke weight of the different shapes as I really enjoyed looking at the variety of thickness of the shapes.
Pascal Dombis – Irrational Geometrics (2005 – 2015):
Pascal uses the idea of ellipses and the stroke on the ellipses to create a seemingly infinite piece of work such as in Irrational Geometrics. His idea was that if you took a line segment and stretched it, it would make a curve, if you continued stretching you would make an ellipse and so forth until you had a line again. “This series thus works on the stretching of the line and pushes to the extreme this principle of false straight but true curves which by saturation give the illusion of being straight.” - http://dombis.com/works/irrational-geo/
I liked this work as it made use of lines to create an entangled mess that could be interpreted as many different things by different people.

Development process: 
My idea was to have various items that moved autonomously around my canvas that were changed by various events such as mouse click, and different buttons being pressed.
I started by developing the html page that would have my JavaScript file imbedded within it. I did this by opening a file and saving it as index.html which would be read as the websites home page. I then linked the script files and CSS files to this file to set out the pages look and feel.
I continued by setting up the various items I would need such as a header, footer and paragraphs that would contain certain items. The CSS contains important items for the webpage such as formatting for the text and colours for certain elements.
I started my JavaScript file by creating a Setup and Draw function that would do different things within the program and help me succeed within my project. I also used various classes and objects within my script to produce many similar objects that contained differences.  

Some of the ideas I had come up with had certain limitations such as not being able to program something to that level yet by myself, such as having a trail of different ellipses that follow the cursor, after having looked at an example of this found on the p5.js website I decided that I could not replicate something of this standard as it used many functions and variables that I had not heard of yet. This was one of many problems I had whilst coding. Another being that I kept becoming confused of the X and Y axis for a screen using pixels as I starts within the top left corner of the screen whereas most graphs do not. I learnt how to counter this problem very quickly as I tried to use many items that would require me to use this mapping system.  

One Insight I had was that a user has great freedom within what they could do with creative coding and that users are not really restricted with the content they can create if they have knowledge of how to code something like that and execute it properly.

Some future upgrades I would add to my program would include items such as a totally customisable canvas that would take inputs from the user and use them for certain items within the script, such as having a textbox that takes in a value and sets the circle size to that of the input. I would like to take this further to make it fully customisable to the user so that the user experiences will be unique.
